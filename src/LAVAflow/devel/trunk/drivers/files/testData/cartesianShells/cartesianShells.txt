This is a 3D Cartesian dataset composed of a core, a surrounding shell, and an ambient medium.
The grid is a 7-level AMR structure with increasing spatial resolution away from the core (centered at [0,0,0]).

The available grid variables are:

VARI    Distance from the core (r=sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2))
RAND    Random number in each cell in the range [-1,1]
CORE    Tracer which is 1.e0 inside the core and 0.0 outside
SHEL    Tracer which is 1.e0 inside the shell and 0.0 outside
AMB     Tracer which is 1.e0 outside of the shell and 0.0 otherwise
FLD     Field which is the composition of specified CORE, SHEL, and AMB values
