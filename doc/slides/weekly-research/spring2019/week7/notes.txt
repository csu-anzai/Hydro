Notes for this week:

Plot difference between fluxes obtained via wavelet algorithm an without.
Normalize.

FFMpeg package for compression/visualization. Also look at matlab movie
properties.

overlay actual solution with wavelet

test on scalar advection problem, find 
effect of thresholding on convergence


bring up valivyev's results on error affect on smooth problems


visualizations on overleaf
