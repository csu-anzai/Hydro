    % section introducing cell averaged data
    \section{Data Averages}
    Let's suppose we are looking at data on an interval $x \in [0,1]$, where
    $x$ is the coordinate along this interval. Suppose there is a function
    $u(x)$ defined on this interval. This function is discretized by cutting the
    interval into a number of cells, $N$.
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \center
        \input{interval.tex}
        \caption{Interval with $N=8$.}
    \end{figure}
    We denote the centers of each cell as $x_{i}$, and the left and right
    boundaries as $x_{i-1/2}$ and $x_{i+1/2}$, respectively.  We define the
    width of each cell as $\triangle x = \frac{1}{N} = x_{i+1/2} - x_{i-1/2}$. For each cell we
    calculate the average amount of $u$ in each interval, and we denote these
    averages as $\overline{u}_{i}$. This is done by perfoming integration of
    $u(x)$ within the cell as
    \begin{equation}
        \overline{u}_{i} = \frac{1}{\triangle x} \int_{x_{i-1/2}}^{x_{i+1/2}}
        u(x) dx.
    \end{equation}

    % section introducing data compression
    \section{Wavelet Transform}
    Now let's imagine that we have a second grid measuring the same function,
    but with half the number of intervals ($N=4$).
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \center
        \input{dual_interval.tex}
        \caption{Fine grid with $N=8$ and coarse grid with $N=4$.}
    \end{figure}
    Note that each cell on the coarse level has two child cells which live on
    the fine grid. We can \textit{predict} the child values on the finer grid by
    creating an interpolating polynomial based on coarse grid values. Denote the
    coarse cells by $u_{i}^{c}$ and the fine cells by $u_{i}^{f}$. The
    prediction is made with the following interpolation
    \begin{equation}
        \tilde{u}^{f}_{2i} = u^{c}_{i} - \frac{1}{8} \left( u^{c}_{i-1} -
        u^{c}_{i+1} \right) 
    \end{equation}
    Then we want to compute the difference between this polynomial
    approximation, and the true value that we know. We compute the difference
    for each coarse cell,
    \begin{equation}
        d^{c}_{i} = u^{f}_{2i} - \tilde{u}^{f}_{2i}.
    \end{equation}
    Note that near the boundaries we need to use biased interpolation. On the
    left boundary compute
    \begin{equation}
        \tilde{u}^{f}_{2i} = \frac{5}{8} u^{c}_{i} + \frac{1}{2} u^{c}_{i+1}
        -\frac{1}{8} u^{c}_{i+2}.
    \end{equation}
    Near the right boundary compute
    \begin{equation}
        \tilde{u}^{f}_{2i} = \frac{11}{8} u^{c}_{i} - \frac{1}{2} u^{c}_{i-1}
        + \frac{1}{8} u^{c}_{i-2}.
    \end{equation}
